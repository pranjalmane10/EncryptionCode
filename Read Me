https://github.com/pranjalmane10/EncryptionCode  Added AES encryption for database connection string using 16-character key in .NET MVC
Secure Connection String Handling
This application secures the connection string using AES-128 encryption.
 How it works:
- The actual connection string is encrypted and saved in `appsettings.json`
- A 16-character key (128-bit) is required for encryption/decryption
- The key should be stored securely (e.g., environment variable or key vault)
Key Format:
Must be **exactly 16 characters** long (e.g., `MyMangoWasp12345`)
 Why this is needed:
Storing credentials in plain text in configuration files is a security risk. AES encryption ensures confidentiality of sensitive data.
 How to encrypt:
A utility method is provided to encrypt your connection string before storing it in the config.
